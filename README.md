##  Who are you, and what do you do?

![Insync](/insync.jpg)

I'm Mark Steve Samson, and I'm a web developer at
[Insync](https://www.insynchq.com).

## What hardware do you use?

![MacBook Pro](/mbp.jpg)

I was given a 2010 MBP when I first started in Insync. For gaming, I was a
desktop guy before, but last December 2012 I decided to switch to a more mobile
machine. Now I do my open source stuff with my MBP and real work and gaming
with a Lenovo Y500 SLI.

The Y500 has 2x GT650m and a beefy i7 processor. I
replaced its boot drive with a micro SSD (I can no longer imagine working on a
machine without an SSD) and turned the old one to a data drive. Performance-wise
it's a beast, but it still weighs a lot and is bigger than what I want it to be.
I also have a PS3 I hardly use anymore, lots of controller pads, lots of
external drives and an iPhone.

## And what software?

* Sublime Text/vim for text editing
* Git/Mercurial for version control
* Github for open source
* Bitbucket for stuff I want hidden
* Chrome
* Drive + Insync for cloud storage
* Keepassx
* Truecrypt
* Tarsnap for daily backups (@reboot and every 12am)
* Gmail for email
* Trello for project management and personal lists
* Pinboard for bookmarking
* Cloudflare
* Namecheap
* Linode/Digital Ocean
* Steam for gaming

## What would be your dream setup?

Near future: I like what they did with the Razer Blade. It will be the trend
for the next generation laptops so I'm pretty excited about that. I can't wait
for machines as small as Airs being able to run my Steam games.

Far future: Laptops/tables/phones will be replaced by thin clients and
everything happens in the cloud. I don't want them to be wearable though.
