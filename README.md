##  About

![Insync](https://rawgithub.com/marksteve/use/master/insync.jpg)

I'm Mark Steve Samson, and I'm a web developer at
[Insync](https://www.insynchq.com).

## Hardware

I was given a 2010 MBP when I first started in Insync. For gaming, I was a
desktop guy before, but last December 2012 I decided to switch to a more mobile
machine to play my Steam games with. It was a Lenovo Y500 SLI which served
me well for almost a year. These days, my main machine is a MSI GE40
with SSD and memory upgrades.

I also have a PS3 I hardly use anymore, lots of controller pads, lots of
external drives and an iPhone.

## Software

* Sublime Text/vim for text editing
* Git/Mercurial for version control
* Github for open source
* Bitbucket for stuff I want hidden
* Chrome
* Drive + Insync for cloud storage
* Keepassx
* Truecrypt
* Tarsnap for daily backups (@reboot and every 12am)
* Gmail for email
* Trello for project management and personal lists
* Pinboard for bookmarking
* Cloudflare
* Namecheap
* Linode/Digital Ocean
* Steam for gaming

## Dream Setup

Near future: I like what they did with the Razer Blade. It will be the trend
for the next generation laptops so I'm pretty excited about that. I can't wait
for machines as small as Airs being able to run my Steam games.

Far future: Everything happens in the cloud. No more local storage. Everything is streamed.
